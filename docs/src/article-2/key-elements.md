# Key Elements of a Blockchain
----------------------------

Key elements of the blockchain include a **distributed ledger technology (DLT)**, **immutable records (IR)** and **smart contracts (SC)**. These aspects are important to understand before we explain how the blockchain itself works. We will tackle each facet individually.

## Distributed Ledger Technology
**Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)** is simply a fancy name for **blockchain technology**, which as we know, was introduced by **Bitcoin**. DLT '*refers to the technological infrastructure and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner across a network that's spread across multiple entities or locations*'.<sup>[\[5\]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp)</sup> This is exactly what a blockchain requires in order to function, since all network participants (miners/consumers) need to be able to simultaneously access and validate the blockchain itself. The core goal of DLT is about having a *"decentralized" network against the conventional "centralized" mechanisms*<sup>[\[5\]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp)</sup> we see all over the web today.

## Immutable Records
The core philosophy of **immutable records** is to be able to record data in a ledger without the threat of existing records being changeable. In turn, this makes sure that '*security is very tight*'.<sup>[\[6\]](https://www.solulab.com/what-is-immutable-ledger-in-blockchain-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Immutable%20ledger%20in%20blockchain%20refers,to%20make%20changes%20without%20collusion.)</sup> In terms of blockchain, this means that no transactions saved within the blockchain ledger are changeable and thus can't be tampered with. This also comes with a potential downside, in that '*if a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible*'.<sup>[\[6\]](https://www.solulab.com/what-is-immutable-ledger-in-blockchain-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Immutable%20ledger%20in%20blockchain%20refers,to%20make%20changes%20without%20collusion.)</sup>

## Smart Contracts
**Smart contracts** are '*programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met*'.<sup>[\[6\]](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts#:~:text=Smart%20contracts%20are%20simply%20programs,intermediary%27s%20involvement%20or%20time%20loss.)</sup> Generally speaking, these conditions that are defined include '*corporate bond transfers, travel insurance to be paid and much more*'.<sup>[\[7\]](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain)</sup> The main reason we have smart contracts is to speed up the many transactions which are stored within a blockchain. Without them, transactions might be slow to store and determine. The most common use-case is to '*automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss*'.<sup>[\[8\]](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts#:~:text=Smart%20contracts%20are%20simply%20programs,intermediary%27s%20involvement%20or%20time%20loss.)</sup>
