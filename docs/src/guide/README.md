# Introduction

When people think of Blockchain technology, the first things that usually come to mind are Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. While the 'Blockchain' as we know today was created by a person under the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto, to serve as a public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions <sup>[\[1\]](https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain)</sup>, the blockchain technology itself was inspired by several technologies that came beforehand such as the [Merkle tree](https://101blockchains.com/merkle-trees/), that attempted to solve similar problems. There were several references to blockchain technology before Bitcoin's introduction in 2008 (see sidebar) <sup>[\[3\]](https://cryptocurrencyworks.com/.res/doc/Bitcoin-SNakamoto-Oct-2008.pdf)</sup>, with the first mention of 'cryptographically secured chain of blocks' being described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta. <sup>[\[4\]](https://www.icaew.com/technical/technology/blockchain-and-cryptoassets/blockchain-articles/what-is-blockchain/history)</sup> The core mission of Bitcoin and its Blockchain technology was to be a form of cash that could be sent peer-to-peer without the need for a central bank or other authority entity to operate (like physical cash).
